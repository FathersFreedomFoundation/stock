Stock Price Prediction App üìà

Overview
The Stock Price Prediction App is an AI-powered web application that predicts future stock prices based on historical data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. This application allows users to input a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, NVDA), and it fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance, trains a machine learning model, and provides both visualizations and performance metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for time-series prediction and serves as an educational tool for understanding how neural networks can be applied to financial markets.

Features üöÄ
LSTM Model: Uses an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data.
Real-Time Stock Symbol Input: Users can input any stock symbol (e.g., NVDA, AAPL) to generate predictions.
Data Visualization: Graphically displays predicted vs actual stock prices in a sleek, interactive interface.
Performance Metrics: Provides key evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Web Interface: Clean, user-friendly web interface built with Flask that allows users to interact with the model and get instant predictions.
Fully Deployed: Can be deployed on any web server and includes static files for enhanced functionality.

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
Input: The user enters a valid stock symbol into the input field.
Data Retrieval: The app fetches the stock‚Äôs historical data using the yfinance API.
Data Preprocessing: The historical closing prices are normalized using the MinMaxScaler.
LSTM Model: The app uses an LSTM neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical patterns.
Prediction & Visualization: The app predicts the stock prices, compares them with actual values, and plots them in a graph.
Metrics: The app displays important performance metrics such as RMSE to evaluate the model‚Äôs prediction accuracy.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Python: Core language for machine learning and backend processing.
Flask: Web framework to serve the application.
Keras/TensorFlow: Used to build and train the LSTM neural network model.
scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and performance evaluation.
yfinance: API to fetch historical stock data.
Matplotlib: For graph visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices.
HTML/CSS: For the web interface, providing a black-themed aesthetic with glowing blue text.

Usage üìä
Navigate to the Home Page:

Upon launching the app, you'll be greeted with an input field asking for a stock symbol.
Enter a Stock Symbol:

Type in any valid stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, TSLA) and click "Predict."
View Results:

The app will fetch the data, run predictions, and display a graph comparing actual vs predicted prices. It will also show performance metrics like RMSE.

Future Enhancements üõ†Ô∏è
Additional Metrics: Adding more evaluation metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
User Authentication: Implementing a login system where users can save their predictions.
Prediction Time Range: Adding the ability to predict stock prices over different time horizons (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, etc.).
Model Improvements: Fine-tuning the LSTM model for better accuracy and trying other models like GRU or Transformer.
